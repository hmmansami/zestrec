### Detailed Description (2,000-4,000 characters recommended)

**Boost AOV with smart product recommendations on every page — 100% free.**

ZestRec adds intelligent "You may also like" and "Frequently bought together" recommendations from your homepage to product pages to cart — all powered by Shopify's native AI. No monthly fees. No revenue share. Just more sales.

**Show the right products at the right moment:**

Add recommendations anywhere your customers shop:
- **Product pages** — "Customers also viewed" to increase discovery
- **Cart page** — Smart upsells before checkout to boost AOV
- **Homepage** — Personalized picks to engage returning visitors
- **Collection pages** — Related products to keep customers browsing

**Switching from another app? Easy migration.**

Coming from Wiser, Glood, Also Bought, Recomatic, or Frequently Bought Together? ZestRec works out of the box with your existing theme. Simple widget code — swap it in minutes, not hours.

**Why merchants choose ZestRec:**

Unlike recommendation apps charging $29-$299/month, ZestRec is completely free. We use Shopify's built-in Product Recommendations API — the same intelligence Shopify uses internally. No external data syncing, no ML models to train, no ongoing costs.

**Always accurate, always current:**

Recommendations automatically update when you add products, change collections, or update your catalog. Zero maintenance required — your suggestions stay fresh without lifting a finger.

**Built for speed:**

Our lightweight widget loads asynchronously and won't tank your Lighthouse scores. Fast pages = happy customers = more conversions.

**Works with your existing stack:**

ZestRec plays nicely with Shopify themes (Dawn, Debut, custom), Shopify Flow, and your existing analytics. Clean integration, no conflicts.

**Privacy-first approach:**

We only access product data — never customer PII. No tracking pixels, no data selling. Your store data stays yours.

## ❓ FAQ Section

### About ZestRec

**Q: Is ZestRec really free? What's the catch?**
Yes, 100% free — no catch. We use Shopify's native Product Recommendations API, which is already included in your Shopify subscription. No monthly fees, no revenue share, no premium tiers. We built ZestRec to prove that great recommendations don't require expensive external services.

**Q: How is this different from LimeSpot, Wiser, or Glood?**
Those apps charge $20-400/month and use external ML systems. ZestRec uses Shopify's built-in AI (free), so you get solid recommendations without the cost. If you need advanced segmentation or email integrations, paid apps offer more — but most stores just need good "related products" widgets, and that's what ZestRec delivers.

### Getting Started

**Q: How long does setup take?**
Under 5 minutes. Install the app, copy the widget code, paste it in your theme. That's it. No configuration wizards, no onboarding calls, no waiting for data to sync.

**Q: Do I need coding skills?**
Nope. We provide ready-to-paste widget code. If you can edit a Shopify theme section (or ask your developer to), you can use ZestRec. We also offer a JSON API for custom implementations.

**Q: Can I customize how recommendations look?**
Yes. The widget inherits your theme's CSS by default. For advanced styling, you can use our JSON endpoint and build your own display — full flexibility.

### Technical

**Q: Will ZestRec slow down my store?**
No. Our widget loads asynchronously (non-blocking) and weighs under 5KB. We follow Shopify's performance guidelines — your Lighthouse score won't suffer.

**Q: How accurate are the recommendations?**
Very. Shopify's native API analyzes your full catalog, collections, tags, and purchase patterns. It's the same intelligence powering Shopify's own "You may also like" sections — battle-tested across millions of stores.

**Q: What if I have thousands of products?**
No problem. Shopify's API handles catalogs of any size. Recommendations stay fast and relevant whether you have 50 or 50,000 SKUs.

### Privacy & Data

**Q: What data does ZestRec access?**
Only what's needed: product catalog (titles, images, prices, variants) and basic store settings. We never access customer personal data, payment info, or order history.

**Q: Do you sell my data?**
Never. Your store data stays yours. We don't share, sell, or use it for advertising. Period.

**Q: What happens if I uninstall?**
We delete all your store data within 48 hours. No lingering copies, no "we might need it later."
